🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Breast Cancer Prediction System using Machine Learning in Python.
The goal is to classify tumors as Benign or Malignant based on medical diagnostic features.
The entire workflow is implemented and demonstrated in a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze breast cancer data

To train machine learning models for prediction

To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

To deploy the model using a simple web interface in Colab
